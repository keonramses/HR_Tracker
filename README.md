# Why does this exist?
In light of the pandemic that has brought most of the world to a grinding halt, organizations and businesses having to switch to a work from home model, but this in itself has brought along with it a problem, not every organization has a functioning human resource tracker, thereby causing a lapse in information on 
who is in and has what duty, with them having to call/email most of the time to verify thereby losing valuable time.

# Does it Work?
While this is in no means by itself a perfect product, the implementation of this project aims to fix the aforementioned problem, by making the 
information that is needed easily available and at a glance, and this would in turn reduce the time lost trying to find out by who has what duty significantly.

# Who can use it?
That depends on your intended usecase, but this project despite being a pet project is mostly intended for businesses that don't require all the fancy functions 
present in premium HR software like logged hours, pay calculation or work history etc. just think of this project as a basic whiteboard that employees can easily
refer to, when they need to find basic information such as who's working, where and who has specific roles.

# Will you add the aforementioned fancy features?
Unfortunately there is no plan in the works to add said features.

# What do you plan to do then?
I am glad you asked that, while this project does do everything i wanted it to do when i initially started it, it is however in a very crude state so going 
forward i plan to rewrite the codebase and optimize (tie up loose ends hehee) the project as a whole with the main intent to make it as dynamic as possible
to make it easily deployable should you want to use it regardless of your business focus so as long as your usecase fits what intended the project for.

# I make your project more badass than it is right now!
By all means please do, but bear in mind the current license attached to the project, i don't care if decide not to pay your respects (shout me out please)
just remember open-source is life.
